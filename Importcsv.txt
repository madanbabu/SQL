Key points to consider:

Replace 'NewDB' with your desired database name if you want to use a different name.
Adjust the table schema (Column1 INT, Column2 VARCHAR(50) etc.) to match your CSV file's structure.

Update the file path 'C:\temp\YourFileName.csv' to match the location and name of your CSV file.

This query assumes the CSV file *has* a header row. If not, remove HDR=YES from the OPENROWSET parameters.
Make sure the SQL Server service account has read permissions on the CSV file location.


Best practices:
Always backup your database before performing bulk imports.
Consider using BULK INSERT for larger datasets, as it may be faster than OPENROWSET.
Validate the imported data after the import to ensure accuracy.
If the CSV file contains special characters or formatting issues, you might need to adjust the OPENROWSET parameters further.
This query provides a straightforward way to import a CSV file into a new MSSQL database table. Remember to test this in a development environment first before running it on production systems.
